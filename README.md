# Environmental Relationship Management

ERM helps manage the protection and regeneration process of Earth - from inspirations, to: initial assessments, public campaigns, intervention planning, monitoring, validation, and communication between earthlings.

## Taking cues from the development of the internet, all parts of the system are:

* In the ‘open-source’ domain and maintained by non-profit foundations with open governance structures (both mature communities, and emerging ones with scalability to large communities).
* Universal access (as a right) for individuals as well as organizations (public and private, for- and not-for-profit).
* Designed to ensure massive “planetary-scale” capability is achievable, drawing upon stress-tested approaches in sectors like telecommunication.
* Enhancement of community governance and access to expert knowledge (embedded in tools and data services).

## Requirements for the architecture include:

* Interoperability of global, regional, national and sub-national monitoring and reporting systems, as well as monitoring of diverse intervention types.
* Capacity to ‘mashup’ of datasets, for decision support and learning.
* Availability of local environmental data in real-time (or as close as possible); support for multi-user dialogue/collaborative design.
* Customizability to context-specific processes, and sharing of knowledge and innovations between users, according to their preference.
* Highly secure private data storage as well as permanent and uncensorable access to public data (and published open-access analyses thereof).
* Resilient compute architecture without tolerance for downtime (either for maintenance or disaster), given the life-critical functionalities being developed.

## Starting up the application server

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
